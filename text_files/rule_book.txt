Official rule book of Random golf!

This game is not your typical round of golf, 
in this game we will only play 1 hole. 
Before each shot, your caddie will present two options, 
it can be to play driver or iron, chip or putt, etc. 
You need to guess which shot is the best, 
and when you enter your choice the fall out is presented. 

The same procedure applys to the next shot and the next,
until the ball is in the hole. 

Good luck and have fun!
