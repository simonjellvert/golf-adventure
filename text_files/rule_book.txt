Official rule book of Random golf!

This game is not your typical round of golf, 
in this game we will play 3 holes. 
Before each shot, your caddy will present two options, 
it can be to play driver or iron, chip or putt, etc. 
When you choose your type of shot, 
the computer will randomly choose the outcome. 

The same procedure applys to the next shot and the next,
until the ball is in the hole. 

Good luck and have fun!
