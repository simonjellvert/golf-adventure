Feeling warmed up? Perfect! Let's get this round started

This is our first hole, it's a 350 meters long par 4.

The left side is out of bounce, which means if you hit it there 
you are going to need to hit your 3rd shot from the tee box.

On the right side there's a grove, if you hit it there you might have to
just lay up.

You can either choose to hit a driver, with the risk of ending up in one of the hazards.
Or you can choose the play a safe shot, which is a long iron.

Press 1 for driver.
Press 2 for iron.
