Brave choice. Remember, the left side is not where we want to be.

Nice shot, you avoided the out of bounce and ended up in the rough on the right hand side.

You're now 150 meters away from the hole. There's a bunker on the back side of the green and on the left side, the left one is really steep and is hard to get out of.
You normally play your 6 iron from this distance, but maybe it's better to play the 7 iron, which goes shorter?
Press 6 for 6 iron
ress 7 for 7 iron
